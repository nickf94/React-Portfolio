          <p>Hello, my name is Nick. I am currently studying to become<br /> a web developer through Coder Academy's fast track bootcamp.<br />
          In my spare time (which let's face it... isn't that much) I like to take photos<br /> of pretty much anything that catches my eyes.
          I started getting into coding last year<br /> when i did a degree in engineering. While it was a hard course, i did however<br /> enjoy the programming side of the course.
          But I didn't start to properly look into programming as a job<br /> until a good friend of mine told me about the coder academy fast track boot camp<br /> and said that i should give it a go.
          So off i went to find out all that i could about web development<br /> and the coder academy course. I have been fairly technical growing up but I never expected<br /> to get into a web developer course
          let alone possibly getting a job as a web developer.<br /> So here i am coding my way through this course one day at a time.
